# Simple-Checkbook

##Description
This Java project was a class assignment. A small log that helps keep track of personal deposits and withdrawal.  The application can save
the log and load them at the same time.  The offline application is meant to keep track of checkbook transactions rather than just being a bank
account balance. 

##How to Run
TBD

##Known Issues
 - There are currently no validations.  Wrong input in the wrong fields may result to strange behaviors
 - A Set amount of deposits/withdrawal logs can be stored
 - Current balance text overlaps other set text

##Next Steps
- Reposition current balance text
- Implement Valdidations
- Reformat UI
